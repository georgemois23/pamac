<h1>Personal Website Project</h1>

<p>This is a personal website project created by George Moysiadis <i>for personal use, not for commercial purposes</i>.</p>
<p>You can view the website here: <a href="http://www.pamac.moysiadis.codes" target="_blank">www.pamac.moysiadis.codes</a></p>

<p>This project is built using React.js. The main purpose is to learn new web development technologies while creating a stylish website that reflects my personal preferences.</p>

<p>The primary feature of this website is a wall where users can upload messages either with their credentials or anonymously.</p>

<p>The project is still under construction; the main structure of the front end is almost complete. The backend is not yet implemented, as I am currently learning Spring Boot to manage the database and user interactions.</p>
